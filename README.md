# Boston Housing Prices Dataset
## Overview
The Boston Housing Prices dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis. It contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset has been widely used to study regression models and techniques for predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following features:

* CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
* ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
* CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
* NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
* RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
* AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
* DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
* RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
* PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
* B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
* LSTAT: % lower status of the population

The target variable is:
* MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## Usage
This dataset can be used for various regression tasks, including:

Predicting median housing prices based on the given features.
Studying the relationship between different features and housing prices.
Testing and evaluating different regression algorithms and techniques.
## Dataset Source
The dataset is available in the sklearn.datasets module in scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. It can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and various other sources.
